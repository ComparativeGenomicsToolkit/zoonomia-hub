* data naming problems
** Alignment has Canis_lupus, Grey Wolf, but spread sheet says this
should be Canis_lupus_familiaris Domestic dog (village dog)	1. Zoonomia	GCA_004027395
** Alignment has Tupaia_chinensis
Spreadsheet has Tupaia_belangeri_chinensis	Northern tree shrew	2. Existing assembly	GCF_000334495.1
choices are:
  Tupaia chinensis (Chinese tree shrew) GCA_000334495.1/GCF_000334495.1
  Tupaia belangeri  (Northern tree shrew) GCA_000181375.1
so alignment looks fine an spreed sheet is wrong.
