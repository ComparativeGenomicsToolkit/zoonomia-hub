* data naming problems
** Alignment has Canis_lupus, Grey Wolf, but spread sheet says this
should be Canis_lupus_familiaris Domestic dog (village dog)	1. Zoonomia	GCA_004027395
** Alignment has Tupaia_chinensis
Spreadsheet has Tupaia_belangeri_chinensis	Northern tree shrew	2. Existing assembly	GCF_000334495.1
choices are:
  Tupaia chinensis (Chinese tree shrew) GCA_000334495.1/GCF_000334495.1
  Tupaia belangeri  (Northern tree shrew) GCA_000181375.1
so alignment looks fine an spreed sheet is wrong.

* 2022-11-07 attempt to move to GenArk terack hub
/cluster/home/hiram/kent/src/hg/makeDb/doc/zoonomiaAsmHub/zoo241.equivalence.tsv

bin/editGenomes

** problems:
blocked by need to rename genomes in HAL
some genomes not in chromAlias

* 2022-11-09 building chromAlias files
generate chromAlias files for track hub.
  bin/aliasBuilder
  bin/chromAlias.mk

** problems:
*** find correct chromAlias file in GenArk required looking
at both zoonomia and genark accession mappings
*** deciding which column to use in genark chromAlias was not
straight-forward

** decided to go with ids keys to generate a chromAlias
** Bison_bison is refseq in genark and genbank in zoonomia, however this is okay, since it
uses genbank ids.
    idKeys Bison_bison 450181 GCA_000754665.1 128431 0.2852874732607551
    Bison_bison GCF_000754665.1 Bison_bison poor coverage for chromAlias: 128431/450181
