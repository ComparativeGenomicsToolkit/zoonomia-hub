<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These tracks show constrained regions calculated by the Zoonomia Project</p>

<ul>
  <li>Ultraconserved elements (zooUCEs):
    Ultraconserved elements identified from the 241-mammals genome alignment. All regions >=20bp where
    at least 235 species aligned and all aligning species are fixed for the same base at every position. N=4,552; 20-190 bp.
  <li> Runs of contiguous constraint (RoCCs):
    All genomic regions where contiguous bases have phyloP score > 2.270 (5% FDR) and are therefore under high
    constraint. Regions separated by a single base with phyloP < 2.270 were merged. N = 595,535; 20-1,359 bp. 
  <li> Unannotated Intergenic Constrained Regions (UNICORNs):
    Non-coding regions of the genome that lack annotation in ENCODE3 but show high evolutionary constraint, suggesting function.
    Positions with phyloP > 2.270 (5% FDR) within 5bp of each other are grouped into UNICORNs. N = 424,180; 11 - 1,325 bp.
